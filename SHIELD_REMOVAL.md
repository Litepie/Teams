# Shield Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Composer Dependencies
- **Removed**: `"litepie/shield": "^1.0"` from `composer.json`
- The package now uses a built-in permission system instead of relying on Litepie Shield

### 2. Team Model Updates
- **Removed**: `use Litepie\Shield\Traits\HasRoles;` import
- **Removed**: `use HasRoles;` trait usage
- The model now implements role and permission management through its own methods:
  - `userHasRole()`
  - `userHasPermission()`
  - `updateMemberRole()`
  - `updateMemberPermissions()`

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Updated feature list to mention "Built-in role and permission management system"

- Updated the "Permissions & Roles" section to show built-in methods

#### IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

#### CHANGELOG.md

## Built-in Permission System

The package now includes a comprehensive built-in permission system that provides:

### Role Management
- Team-based roles (owner, admin, moderator, member)
- Role hierarchy and permissions
- Configurable default roles

### Permission Control
- Granular permission management
- Team-specific permissions
- Permission caching

### Usage Examples
```php
// Role management
$team->addMember($user, 'admin');
$team->userHasRole($user, 'admin');
$team->updateMemberRole($user, 'moderator');

// Permission checking
$team->userHasPermission($user, 'edit_settings');
$team->updateMemberPermissions($user, ['edit_content', 'manage_files']);
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Reduced Dependencies**: One less external dependency to manage
2. **Simplified Setup**: No need to configure and manage Shield
3. **Team-Focused**: Permission system is specifically designed for team contexts
4. **Better Integration**: Built-in system integrates seamlessly with team workflows
5. **Easier Testing**: Simpler permission testing without external dependencies

## Migration Guide

For existing applications using Shield with Teams:

1. Update composer dependencies: `composer update`
2. Update any custom code that relied on Shield's team permission methods
3. Use the new built-in permission methods instead:
   - Replace `$user->hasPermissionTo('permission', $team)` with `$team->userHasPermission($user, 'permission')`
   - Replace `$team->assignMemberRole($user, 'role')` with `$team->addMember($user, 'role')`
4. Update any Blade templates that used Shield directives to use standard authorization directives

The Teams package now provides a complete, self-contained permission system specifically designed for team management scenarios.
