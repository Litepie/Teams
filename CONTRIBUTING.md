- **Documentation**: Update docs if your changes affect the API

### Conventional Commits

We use conventional commits for clear history:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add team analytics dashboard
fix: resolve member invitation email bug
docs: update installation instructions
test: add integration tests for team workflows
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/TeamManagementTest.php

# Run specific test method
./vendor/bin/pest --filter="it can create team"
```

### Writing Tests

We use [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for testing. Here's a sample test:

```php
<?php

use Litepie\Teams\Models\Team;
use Litepie\Teams\Actions\CreateTeamAction;

it('can create a team with valid data', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    $result = CreateTeamAction::execute(null, [
        'name' => 'Test Team',
        'description' => 'A test team',
        'type' => 'development',
    ], $user);
    
    expect($result)
        ->toBeInstanceOf(Team::class)
        ->name->toBe('Test Team')
        ->owner_id->toBe($user->id);
});

it('validates required fields', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    expect(fn() => CreateTeamAction::execute(null, [], $user))
        ->toThrow(ValidationException::class);
});
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/`): Test individual classes and methods
- **Feature Tests** (`tests/Feature/`): Test complete features and workflows
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/Integration/`): Test package integrations

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use PHP DocBlocks for all public methods
- Include parameter types and return types
- Explain complex logic with inline comments

```php
/**
 * Create a new team with the specified configuration.
 *
 * @param array $data The team data including name, description, and settings
 * @param User $owner The user who will own this team
 * @return Team The newly created team instance
 * @throws ValidationException When validation fails
 * @throws TeamLimitExceededException When user has reached team limit
 */
public function createTeam(array $data, User $owner): Team
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### README Updates

When adding new features, update the README.md with:
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- API documentation

## üé® Code Style

### PHP Standards

We follow PSR-12 coding standards:

```bash
# Fix code style automatically
composer format

# Check code style
composer check-style
```

### Static Analysis

We use PHPStan for static analysis:

```bash
# Run static analysis
composer analyse

# Run with specific level
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=8
```

### Type Coverage

Maintain high type coverage:

```bash
# Check type coverage
composer test:types
```

## üöÄ Release Process

### Versioning

- **PATCH** (2.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` with:
- New features
- Bug fixes

## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Labels

We use these labels to organize issues:

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `question` - Further information is requested
- `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

## üéØ Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one reason to change
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for dependencies
3. **Action Pattern**: Business logic should be in Action classes
4. **Event-Driven**: Use events for loose coupling
5. **Multi-Tenant**: Everything should be tenant-aware

### Best Practices

- Write self-documenting code
- Keep methods small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Avoid deep nesting
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Performance Considerations

- Use database indexes appropriately
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use eager loading for relationships
- Consider pagination for large datasets
